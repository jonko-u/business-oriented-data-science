# Project Title: Employee Retention Improvement

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Project objectives
As the data science director has explained to you, the main objective of the project you are going to work on is to reduce the flight of employees from the company.

To do this, during this week you are going to work on 3 big things:

Understand and quantify the problem from a business point of view
Develop an automated machine learning system that identifies employees who are at highest risk of flight
Successfully communicate results to management

## Acknowledgements


- We have understood how a data science project is done in the business world
- We have seen the 3 components that we have to develop in our project this week:
    * Business Analytics
    * Machine Learning
    * Productivization
- We have had a first contact with the necessary technology: [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn]()
- We have created your Google Colab account to do data science projects on Google computers
- We have learned how to import notebooks and data
- We have had a preview of how the code of a data science project is being made and executed
- We have learned what packages are and how to load them
- We have already uploaded the necessary data for the project
- We have seen what data quality is and why it is so important
- We have done a null analysis and corrected the errors
- We have carried out exploratory analysis on all our variables
- We have learned a couple of functions to make EDA that will allow us to analyze hundreds of variables at a glance
- We have internalized a super useful framework to do Business Analytics and present it in a winning way:
    * Step 1: Quantification of the problem
    * Step 2: Economic impact
    * Step 3: Savings Scenarios
- We have experienced all the possibilities of "pulling the thread" that open up to us when we use this methodology and how you can contribute great practical value to companies with it.
- We have understood what this is about making a model and what it is for
- We have seen the differences between the training and production phases
- We have understood the need to divide the data into train and test
- We have learned how the decision tree algorithm works and how it is interpreted.
- We have trained our first machine learning model
- We already know the main metric to evaluate models and the values that indicate whether a model is good or bad
- We have seen how to use the model to make new predictions
- We have learned to read a decision tree diagram and know the most relevant variables
- We have understood what to do with the predictions and different ways to exploit the results
